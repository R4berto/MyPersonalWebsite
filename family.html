          <p class="description">This is a picture of two couples, Josephine Olaño and Robert Olaño. They have 4 sons, Jonathan, Joshua, Jem and John. I am their youngest son John but you can call me Robert or John but my parents call me Johnny. I included this picture because we don’t have a photo of the 3 of us and I don’t want to miss out on my parents because they are part of me.
